# MIDAS-TASK-1
All the files related to the task


I could not include the rank, score and entry for my codebase as I was having some trouble converting my predictions to a csv file. I did one(pushed that too by the name of submission.csv), but the format was wrong. I have done everything apart from that which can be seen( all the files have been pushed). 

What all does the repository contain-

1) The MIDAS TASK-1 is a pdf file which consists of the entire documentation including experiments, observations and results and my inferences. It also consists of plots, graphs and waveforms and the linkd to the references I used.

2) The entire code is submitted in the form of a jupyter notebook by the name of 'speech_recog.ipynb'

3) A 'submission.csv' file which as mentioned earlier is not correct.
